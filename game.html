All that remained soft was the birthmark on his butt, that served as a reminder that his father was a god. The rival country wages war on his country for their vast resources, so Maximillius' country calls on all the young, able-bodied men to participate in the war. Maximillius wants to prove that he is stronger than his father and enlists in the army.",
            "Maximillius trains hard and gets very proficient with the sword, bow and arrow. His commands are precise and the strategies he comes up with are witty and flexible. He is at the top of his game. His superior notices how hard he is working and offers him a promotion to be a commander of a fleet of ships.", 
            "Maximillius ends up commanding a fleet of 30 ships. After seeing how hard he is working, the God of Smithing, Hephaestus, grants Maximillius sturdy armor and weapons, so that he will be able to prevail in war. Within a month, he sets out toward the ocean to fight for his country, but after a couple of days, Maximillius becomes lost and sees 2 routes.",
            "After getting out of the mist, one of Maximillius' ship gets led astray by the sound of a lullaby. Maximillius remembers that one of his crewman mentions the sirens' myth and realizes that the myth is real. Maximillus tells his other ships to go ahead to give supplies and provide reinforcements for the war, while his own ship goes after the ship that was led astray. He sees an island that the ship goes to.", 
            "Maximillius lands right next to his crewmates' ship. He notices that everybody is gone, so he tells half of his crew to remain on the ship so they can guard it while the other half goes with him to find the missing crewmen. Once he gets off his ship they encounter hostile natives of the island and they try to steal the crew's supplies.",
            "Maximillius defeats the natives to successfully protect his crewmates and and supplies. They find a trail from their missing crewmates, so they follow it and go deeper into the island. They suddenly encounter carnivorous gorillas that kidnap 5 of Maximillius' men to eat. Then the gorillas run back to their base to eat their freshly caught prey.",
            "Maximillus and his crew start chasing after the gorillas. After an exhausting chase, the crew finally ends up at the gorillas' cave. They start fighting against one another and after a very hard battle, Maximillius and his crew finally win and kill the gorillas. They get their men back, but they notice that they are right next to the sirens' home base. The crew sees them frolicking about and gets mesmerized by the beautiful sirens and cute puppies. Maximillius is the only one immune to their charms because of his blessed armor and so he asks the Queen of Sirens to give his men back. She agrees, but wants to make a deal. The deal is that to get Maximilius' men back, Maximillius has to give up his eyesight.",
            "Maximillius loses his eyesight, but he gains the trust of his men in return. They all help Maximillius to the best of their abilities, but Maximillius adapts quickly so he gets used to being blind. They all sail to the rival country and join the war. Maximillius fights ferociously and kills many of the rival country's soldiers.",
            "On the third day of fighting in the war, Maximillius goes back to his tent to rest. Someone accidentally puts a needle on his chair which he sits on. The needle hits his only weak spot, the birthmark, and so Maximillius dies from the pain.",
            "After fighting for 2 years, Maximillius and his army finally win the war. After negotiating with the rival country, Maximillius finally heads back home, where he lives a peaceful, happy life. :D",
            "Just when Maximillius finally enters the battle, a stray arrow accidentally strikes his butt. The arrow hits his only weak spot, the birthmark, so he dies immediately.",
            "Maximillius joins the army but is too weak and gets kicked out of the army and lives a life of disappointment.",
            "Due to the lack of training, Maximillius becomes too weak and dies in battle.",
